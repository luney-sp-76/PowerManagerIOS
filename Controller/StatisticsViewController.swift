/**
This class implements the AxisValueFormatter protocol to format date values as strings for display on a chart axis. The class takes in a double value that represents the number of seconds since the start of the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970). It then converts the double value into a Date object and formats the date using a DateFormatter object.

The DateValueFormatter class has a private property, dateFormatter, that is used to configure the format of the date string. The current implementation sets the format to "MM-dd", which displays the month and day of the date in a two-digit format (e.g., "05-31" for May 31).

The stringForValue() method is called by the chart axis to format each date value as a string. The method first converts the double value to a Date object using the timeIntervalSince1970 property. It then sets the format of the date string using the dateFormatter object and returns the formatted date string.

Note that this class assumes that the input value represents a valid date in the Unix epoch format, and that the DateFormatter object is correctly configured with the desired format. Any changes to these assumptions may require modifications to this class.

The DateValueFormatter class can be used with any chart that implements the AxisValueFormatter protocol, such as a LineChartView or BarChartView.

Note that this class does not handle errors or exceptions that may occur during the date formatting process. Any error handling or exception handling should be performed by the calling code.

    /**
    This function updates the chart views in the app's energy screen with new energy data for a given date range. The function takes in two parameters: a start date and an end date that represent the beginning and end of the date range.

    The function first calls the downloadData() function to download the latest energy data from the Firestore database. It then logs the received start and end dates to the console.

    The function then calls the energyManager.updateEnergyData() function to update the energy data for the given date range. The function takes in a closure that is called with the updated energy data when the update operation is completed.

    If the update operation succeeds and the energy data is not nil, the function calls the energyCostManager.combineEnergyData() function to combine the energy data with the home device data and update the chart views in the app. The function also updates the costOfEnergyLabel with the total cost of the energy data if the total cost is not zero.

    If the update operation fails or the energy data is nil, the function logs an error message to the console.

    Note that this function assumes that the energyManager, energyCostManager, and lineChartView objects are correctly configured and implemented. Any changes to these dependencies may require modifications to this function.

    The updateCharts() function is called using the "await" keyword, which means that the function executes asynchronously and does not block the main thread. This allows the UI to remain responsive while the function is running.

    Parameters:

    startDate: A Date object that represents the start date of the date range.
    endDate: A Date object that represents the end date of the date range.
    Note that the start and end dates should be in the format specified by the dateValueFormat object.

    Note that this function may take some time to complete, depending on the amount of data being downloaded and processed. The calling code should ensure that the function is not called too frequently or with too large of a date range to avoid performance issues or data transfer limits.

    This function downloads the latest home device data from the Firestore database and stores it in the deviceData array. The function orders the data by the lastUpdated field in ascending order.

    The function first retrieves the current user's email from the Firebase authentication service. It then resets the deviceData array to an empty state.

    The function uses a Firestore query to retrieve the home device data from the Firestore database. The query selects all documents in the "devices" collection under the current user's document and orders the data by the "lastUpdated" field in ascending order. The function then loops through the query results and extracts the relevant fields from each document.

    If the extraction of relevant fields from a document is successful, the function creates a new HomeData object and appends it to the deviceData array.

    If any errors occur during the database retrieval or object creation process, the function logs an error message to the console.

    Note that this function assumes that the Firestore database is correctly configured and that the K.FStore constants are defined correctly. Any changes to these dependencies may require modifications to this function.

    /**
    This function generates chart data for a specific time frame to visualize the battery level of home devices. The function takes in two parameters: the start date and the end date of the time frame.

    The function first logs the received start and end dates to the console. It then triggers a display refresh for the battery level chart view to ensure that the chart is up to date.

    The function initializes an empty array for the chart data entries and a DateFormatter to parse the device data's lastUpdated field.

    The function loops through the device data array and selects only the devices that contain the "batteryLevel" entity ID. For each device, the function converts the lastUpdated field to a Date object and checks whether it falls within the specified time frame. If it does, the function extracts the device's battery level as a Double and converts the lastUpdated field to a TimeInterval value. The function creates a new ChartDataEntry object with these values and appends it to the chartDataEntries array.

    After looping through all the relevant device data, the function creates a new LineChartDataSet object with the chartDataEntries array and sets the line chart's properties, such as colors, labels, and axis ranges. The function creates a new LineChartData object with the chartDataSet and sets it as the data for both the lineChartView and the batteryLevelChartView. The function sets the x-axis's value formatter to the dateValueFormat property.

    Note that this function assumes that the device data has already been retrieved from the Firestore database and stored in the deviceData array. Any changes to the device data format or structure may require modifications to this function.

    The batteryChartData(forStartDate:endDate:) function is called with specific start and end dates to generate the chart data for the corresponding time frame. The calling code should ensure that the time frame is valid and not too large to avoid performance issues or data transfer limits.

    Parameters:
    startDate: The start date of the time frame to generate chart data for.
    endDate: The end date of the time frame to generate chart data for.
